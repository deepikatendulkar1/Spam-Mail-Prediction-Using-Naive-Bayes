# ðŸ“§ Spam Mail Prediction Using Naive Bayes

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project builds a spam email classifier using the **Naive Bayes algorithm** with a dataset of **5,171 emails**. The goal is to predict whether an email is spam or not, based on its content. The model achieved **89% accuracy**, using CountVectorizer for text feature extraction.

## ðŸ§  Key Features
- Used **Multinomial Naive Bayes** for binary classification.
- Preprocessed email text and extracted features using **CountVectorizer** (~200 unique tokens).
- Visualized results with confusion matrix and classification metrics.
- Entire pipeline is implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook for ease of experimentation.

## ðŸ—‚ Files in This Repository
- `spamClassifier.ipynb` â€“ Main notebook containing all steps: EDA, preprocessing, model training, evaluation.
- `spam.csv` â€“ Dataset of labeled email messages.
- `README.md` â€“ Project documentation and instructions.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Accuracy: **89%**
- Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score
